workit.py

	workit.py is a simple pipeline processing or "workflow" program. 
workit.py is used when you need to perform a series of sequential
operations on data sets.  It uses the mympi Python MPI module to
spread work across multiple processors.  MPI is used for synchronization
and convenience of launching multiple processors.



	You might use workit.py to post process a collection of output files
to produce images and archive the data.  Say you start with a data file,
surface_11700.z and you want do the following operations:



	* Extract floating point values from a the "raw" data file
	* Create an image from the floating point values file
	* Superimpose a mask on the image
	* Archive the data to long term storage and delete the local copy



	We have below an actual script that performs this workflow.  Note
that the last line actually performs multiple operations.



~/getsubimage < surface_11700.z > surface_11700.flt
~/rgbpng.exe -p I -xmin 1110 -xmax 9984 -ymin 0 -ymax 2000 < surface_11700.flt surface_11700.png
~/composite -dissolve 15 -tile output.png surface_11700.png surface_11700_g.png
ls -lt surface_11700* ; hsi "put surface_11700*" ; rm -rf surface_11700*




	If you have a collection of input files say surface_11700.z to
surface_xxxx.z you can use workit.py to spread the work across multiple
processors.  If you have four steps to your process then you would use 4
processors.  You specify the commands to run in a file named "commands".
 You specify the files to work on on the command line.  A typical mpirun
command would be:



mpirun -np 4 workit.py -s out*





	The first mpi process would run the first command on the input file
surface_11700.z.  Then the second mpi process would perform its
operation on surface_11700.flt at the same time the first process is
working on the second file, surface_11701.z, and so on.  The "-s" option
is discussed below.



The "commands" file corresponding to the script shown above would be:




~/getsubimage < DUMMY.z > DUMMY.flt
~/rgbpng.exe -p I -xmin 1110 -xmax 9984 -ymin 0 -ymax 2000 < DUMMY.flt DUMMY.png
~/composite -dissolve 15 -tile output.png DUMMY.png DUMMY_g.png
ls -lt DUMMY* ; hsi "put DUMMY*" ; rm -rf DUMMY*




	workit.py replaces DUMMY with a file name.  The "-s" option on
command line tells workit.py to strip off the suffix of the input file
names, ".z" in this case.  Thus, in this case, DUMMY would be replaced
with, surface_11700, surface_11701,..., surface_xxxxx.  If the "-s" is
not used then DUMMY is replaced with surface_11700.z,
surface_11701.z,..., surface_xxxxx.z.  This may be what you want to do
is some cases.  Note that the sequential numbering is not significant. 
You could specify all "C" files in a directory using the command:




mpirun -np 4 workit.py -s *c.


 

The "objects" listed on the command line don't even need to be files.



	There are two types of output created by workit.py.  The first is to
the stdout (the terminal).  This output lists the starting and ending
times for the beginning and ending operation on each file.  Below we
have a typical output from running the commands given above on the
collection of files ("surface_11700.z" "surface_11750.z"
"surface_11800.z" "surface_11850.z" "surface_11900.z" "surface_11950.z"
)

	We print the counter into the list of files on which we are
operating as well as the "DUMMY" name.  Note that operations overlap in
time.  We have started working on 4 files before completing the first
series of operations on surface_11700.



	workit.py also saves stdout and stderr for each command on each
file.  This information is saved for each process in a file that has the
process number used as the file name suffix.  For the above example we
have files:




tg-login1 e3druns/redo> ls -l output0*
-rw-r--r--    1 tkaiser  use300        984 2005-11-09 20:35 output0000
-rw-r--r--    1 tkaiser  use300       3216 2005-11-09 20:36 output0001
-rw-r--r--    1 tkaiser  use300       1206 2005-11-09 20:38 output0002
-rw-r--r--    1 tkaiser  use300       9858 2005-11-09 20:38 output0003
tg-login1 e3druns/redo> 




	Each file contains information for each time the command is run. 
The information includes, the start time and end time, the command
string, stdout, and stderr.  For example, the portion of output0000 for
the first file is:




tg-login1 e3druns/redo> cat output0001
2005-11-09 20:32:35.535805
2005-11-09 20:32:57.852294 COMMAND:
~/rgbpng.exe -p I -xmin 1110 -xmax 9984 -ymin 0 -ymax 2000 < surface_11700.flt surface_11700.png
