ex00  This is a simple hello world program. Each node prints out 
      it's rank and the size of the current MPI run (Total number of
      nodes).

ex01  This is a simple send/receive program in MPI

ex02 Program shows how to use probe and get_count to find the size
     of an incomming message

ex03  This is a simple isend/ireceive program in MPI

ex04  This is a simple broadcast program in MPI

ex05 This program shows how to use MPI_Scatter and MPI_Gather
     Each processor gets different data from the root processor
     by way of mpi_scatter.  The data is summed and then sent back
     to the root processor using MPI_Gather.  The root processor
     then prints the global sum. 

ex06 This program shows how to use MPI_Scatter and MPI_Reduce
     Each processor gets different data from the root processor
     by way of mpi_scatter.  The data is summed and then sent back
     to the root processor using MPI_Reduce.  The root processor
     then prints the global sum. 

ex07 This program shows how to use MPI_Alltoall.  Each processor
     send/rec a different  random number to/from other processors.  

ex08 This program shows how to use MPI_Gatherv.  Each processor sends a
     different amount of data to the root processor.  We use MPI_Gather
     first to tell the root how much data is going to be sent.
     do the mpi init stuff

ex09 This program shows how to use MPI_Alltoallv.  Each processor 
     send/rec a different and random amount of data to/from other
     processors.  
     We use MPI_Alltoall to tell how much data is going to be sent.

ex10 This program is designed to show how to set up a new communicator. 
     We set up a communicator that includes all but one of the processors,
     The last processor is not part of the new communcator, TIMS_COMM_WORLD
     We use the routine MPI_Group_rank to find the rank within the new
     connunicator.  For the last processor the rank is MPI_UNDEFINED because
     it is not part of the communicator.  For this processor we call get_input
     The processors in TIMS_COMM_WORLD pass a token between themselves in the
     subroutine pass_token.  The remaining processor gets input, i, from the terminal
     and passes it to processor 1 of MPI_COMM_WORLD.  If i > 100 the program stops
     global variables

ex11 Shows how to use MPI_Type_vector to send noncontiguous blocks of data
     and MPI_Get_count and MPI_Get_elements to see the number of elements sent
     
ex12 Shows how to split processors into two communicators


Makefiles and run scripts are availabe for teragrid and OSX.  For the run scripts
you will need to change the directories to what is required on your machine.
